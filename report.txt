Armit Patel - Cache simulator report - 177006102

	The objective of this assignment was to implement a cache simulator which can evaluate different formats of cachesâ€™. This simulator is to run with a least recently used algorithm and must support the usage given.

	The main data structure used in my program is Drive. This structure has three variables, mark, order, and pass. Mark stores the index of the block and is used to find which block the address is in. Order keeps track of when something is written in the cache and also when hit gets incremented. Order is set to the variable count and that way I can find the Least Recently Used block. The block with the least value of order will be removed. The last variable, pass, keeps track of whether a block is empty or not. A value of 0 in pass means that the block is empty and 1 if it is not. The value of pass can only be 0 or 1. 

	What I observed about prefetching is that in every case, the number of hits and consequently, reads, increased when prefetching is used. Memory writing is the same when prefetching is used and when not. Prefetching makes adjacent addresses be put in the cache when a address is being read and thus decreases the order for misses. I also observed that this causes a shorter runtime.
